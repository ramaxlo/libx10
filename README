libx10: The X-10 protocol implementation in C

The X-10 is an industry standard used for home automation. It uses the power
line to transmit signal among electrical devices, thus no additional wiring
is required. Although its limitation on bandwidth and available addresses,
it's still quite common in home automation area.

The library implements part of the protocol, and uses the CM11A computer
interface module to transmit signals.
